         <h3>Takoyaki (たこ焼き) is a Japanese snack in the shape of little round balls containing pieces of octopus. Tako-yaki literally translates to “octopus-grilled/fried” and some people may call it “Grilled Octopus Balls” or “Octopus Dumplings”.</h3>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>¼ cup katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes)</li>
                <li>2 green onions/scallions</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp pickled red ginger (beni shoga or kizami beni shoga)</li>
                <li>2 oz octopus sashimi (boiled octopus) (you can find cooked octopus in Japanese grocery stores; substitute with sausage, corn, edamame, cheese, small mochi pieces…the choices are endless!)</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp neutral-flavored oil (vegetable, rice bran, canola, etc.)</li>
                <li>⅓ cup tenkasu/agedama (tempura scraps)</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Grind the katsuobushi (bonito flakes) into a fine powder. Set aside; we'll use this powder when we're cooking the takoyaki.</li>
                <li>Cut the green onions into fine slices and mince the red pickled ginger.</li>
                <li>Cut the octopus into ½ inch (1.3 cm) bite-sized pieces (cut into smaller pieces for kids so they can chew it more easily). I use the "rangiri" cutting technique.</li>
                <li>Transfer them onto a plate and drizzle the takoyaki sauce and Japanese mayonnaise on top. Finish the dish with a sprinkling of katsuobushi and dried green seaweed and a side of pickled red ginger. Serve immediately (but be careful—they're VERY hot inside!)</li>
            </ol>
